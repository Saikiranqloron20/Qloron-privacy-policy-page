              What Is A 'Dispute'?
              <br />
              <br />
              A 'Dispute' Can Be Defined As A Disagreement Between A Customer
              And A Merchant In Connection With A Transaction On The Website.

              How Does A 'Dispute' Occur In The Marketplace?
              <br />
              <br />
              Disputes Are Filed As A Result Of A Disagreement Between The
              Customer And The Merchant. Disputes Arise Out Of An Issue That Is
              Raised By Either Party Not Being Completely Satisfied With The
              Resolution Of Their Complaint/Issue.
              <br />
              <br />
              It Is Important That Before A Customer/Merchant Raises A Dispute,
              They Should Attempt To Solve The Issue. Please Note That Whenever
              Customer Raises A Dispute, The Merchant's Payment For That Order
              Is Put On Hold Immediately Until The Issue Is Resolved.
              <br />
              <br />
              What Are The Various Types Of 'Disputes'?

              <br />
              <br />
              In Case The Merchant Rejects The Return Request Of The Customer,
              And Customer Raises A Dispute, Then Our Registered
              Distributor/Franchiser Will Try To Mediate And Resolve The Dispute
